# Test-Assets-UI

## Introduction

The VRIF Testvector database is a tool to allow a dynamic management of the testvectors provided by the VR Industry Forum. This is a fork of the DASH-IF Testvector database. This framework includes:

- Testcontent: the source VR contents.
- Testvectors generated from Testcontents.
- Dynamic management of the attributes of all the models

This repository provides the client-side functionality of the tool.
It is supposed to run alongside the [Test-Assets-Dataset](https://github.com/VR-IF/Test-Assets-Dataset-Public).

## Installing / Getting started

The Test-Assets-UI relies on the [Test-Assets-Dataset](https://github.com/VR-IF/Test-Assets-Dataset-Public) for full functionality. In order to install the UI please follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites
This project requires node.js and the node package manager (npm) to be installed.

### Setup

```shell
git clone https://github.com/VR-IF/Test-Assets-UI-public
cd Test-Assets-UI-public
npm install
npm start
```

### Configuration

Configuration files can be found in `\config`. In order to set the port for the http server which hosting this interface please adjust the `server.port`parameter.
Moreover, for communication with the Test-Assets-Dataset the url to the backend server needs to be set. This can be done by adjusting the `BASE_URL` in `public\js\constants\Constants.js`.
